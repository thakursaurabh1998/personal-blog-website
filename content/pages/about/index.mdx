I am a Software Developer by profession and by my own pure &nbsp;üíñ for it. I believe that knowledge is power, and to keep that power with me, I like to explore new things and study about how the industry is growing and how big players are using the technology to provide the best in class experience to customers like you and me. Also I consider OSS to be a very important part of anyone who is in this industry be it a student who is currently learning things or a tech giant.

I also love to drive and travel and see the beauty that the &nbsp;üåè has left there for me to explore. I participate in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ketto.org">fund raisers</a> for humane causes on a monthly basis and I suggest others to do the same. I consider my family and friends as the most important part of me and love to spend time with them. üòÉ

> Presently I am a Backend Developer at smallcase. As <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/big-things-come-in-small-cases/103692">Fortune India said</a>, smallcase is a new way to invest in the stock market and could change the way how people invest their money.
>
> At smallcase I mainly handle the smallcase API be it B2C or B2B. I have worked on products such as the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://smallcase.com">smallcase platform</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://publisher.smallcase.com">publisher</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://gateway.smallcase.com">gateway</a>. I took a good portion of my time to understand how stock market and brokers work and how we are providing our product on top of it.
> smallcase gave me an opportunity to understand the basics of how the financial system works which I had no idea about previously.

##### Education

I studied Computer Science and Engineering at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://chitkara.edu.in">Chitkara University</a>, Punjab (Batch of 2020).

- Participated in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5362213500485632/">Google Summer of Code 2019</a> with AOSSIE organization working on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint-API">CarbonFootprint-API</a>

- Was the Lead of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/community/dsc">Google Developer Student Club (DSC)</a>, lead a community of student developers, organizing various hackathons and workshops for university students on various topics.

- Took part in various hackathons, but one which left a mark was <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30070727?tab=winners">Call for Code</a>. The subject was natural disaster preparedness and relief, so we (me and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/madhurgupta10">Madhur Gupta</a>) created a decentralized donation platform which can aid the relief process after a disaster.
