I am a Software Developer by profession and by my own pure &nbsp;üíñ for it. I believe that knowledge is power, and to keep that power with me, I like to explore new things and study about how the industry is growing and how big players are using the technology to provide the best in class experience to customers like you and me. Also I consider OSS to be a very important part of anyone who is in this industry, be it a student who is currently learning things or a tech giant.

I also love to drive and travel to see the beauty that the &nbsp;üåè has left there for me to explore. I participate in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ketto.org">fund raisers</a> for humane causes on a monthly basis and I suggest you to do the same. I consider my family and friends as the most important part of me and love to spend time with them. üòÉ
