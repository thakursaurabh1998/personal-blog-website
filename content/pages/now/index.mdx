#### January, 2025

##### Life

- Currently engineering impactful & interesting products at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cred.club">CRED</a>. üë®‚Äçüíª
- Socializing in all new ways. Finding time for friends, making time for new ones.
- Feeling good being back in Bangalore - never knew I will miss the city, but here I am. Life is boring and repetitive, but ironically, it's filled with energy (you know what I mean?).

##### <span id="learning">Learning</span>

I want learnings to be a part of life, but, without invading the fun. The list of things I am currently up to:

##### Travel

I try to travel and do short trips and discover places nearby, wherever I am living. But there are also some special places that I want to go to since time immemorial.

- Just finished "South Circuit". This was a trip I wanted to do since a very long time and as I finally got my bike, had to make this a reality. The special thing about it was the long bike ride (2000+ kilometers), hitting various beautiful South Indian spots and ending the new year on a high note. You can view the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTEzMTQwOTY0MDAzNjE0">highlight of the trip on Instagram</a> for now until it's available on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://imprints.saurabhthakur.dev">Imprints</a>.
- Next up is Leh with friends, let's see if it becomes a reality!
- Want to see snowfall at the end of 2025 in some Himalayan village.
- New Zealand is stuck inside my head now. The natural landscapes that it offers are beautiful. I just dream of driving in a car across New Zealand now and hope to make this a reality soon. üá≥üáø


##### What else?

- Taking time to get bored. Getting comfortable with it.
- Eating good food. It's so easy to miss out on such a simple thing, but feeling great that body doesn't crave the bad food as much now.
- Working out regularly, have made it a part of life. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
