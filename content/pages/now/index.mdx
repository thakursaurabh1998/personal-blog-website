##### <span id="learning">Learning</span>

I want learnings to be a part of life, but, without invading the fun. The list of things I am currently up to:

- Absorbing concepts and wisdoms about building better systems from the following books.

##### Travel

I try to travel and do short trips and discover places nearby, wherever I am living. But there are also some special places that I want to go to since time immemorial.

- Finally ravelled to Spiti 🏔 this summer, a longgggg desire of mine.
- Want to visit Andaman & Nicobar Islands 🏝 by the end of the year. (still speculative)
- Switzerland, some time soon. I can feel the mountains and waterfalls of Lauterbrunnen calling me! 🇨🇭


##### What else?

- Have become a nerd about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://formula1.com">Formula 1 🏎</a> after watching <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8289930/">Drive to Survive</a> on Netflix. Have done so much research about terms, historical events, the cars and obviously the players!
- Trying to workout regularly. 🏋️‍♂️
- Want to work on a side project, manifesting a noble idea that is both technically and socially impacting.
