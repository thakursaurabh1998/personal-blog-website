##### Hello guys 👋

The day has finally come to move on. Was feeling anxious about today for some days because smallcase was my first workplace as a professional and I have come a long way along with the company, so understandably the goodbye part is **really hard**.

I might won't do justice to what smallcase has provided me in the past couple of years with my words but I am **_grateful_** to the folks who put their confidence and trust in me for handling the responsibilities here at smallcase. I was a naive kid who came from college and knew nothing about how a company works and what it takes to work around the hurdles. Well some might say I am still a kid (and I cheerfully accept that 😁) but **I have grown a lot as an individual human**.

I got the opportunity to work on almost all of the products under the smallcase ecosystem and I can vouch for the great and successful future of smallcase, as a company, as a product and as a team.

Ironically the best moments for me were the **P<sub>0</sub>** issues. The bonding spirit that I felt during the **P<sub>0</sub>** bugs is unparalleled to any other experience. People working with high levels of concentration and coordination, taking each other's inputs and processing the task at hand with little to no sleep sometimes made this whole process a source of adrenaline and the sense of accomplishment when the issue is resolved was always on another level. And obviously Rohan's treat.

Moving ahead, we know and understand that a company is actually it's people. There are good people in this world and then there are **great folks**, and I am lucky to have encountered this greatness at smallcase.
